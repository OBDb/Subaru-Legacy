    end_year: 2014
    description: "The fifth-generation Subaru Legacy marked a more mainstream approach for the model, with increased dimensions, more conservative styling, and a greater focus on comfort and interior space. Available in four-door sedan (BM) and, in markets outside North America, five-door wagon (BR) body styles (with the wagon marketed as the Outback in North America regardless of ride height), the new Legacy grew significantly in size to compete more directly with mid-size segment leaders. Engine options were streamlined in many markets to focus on a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated flat-four and a 3.6-liter flat-six, with turbocharged options reduced or eliminated in some regions. All-wheel drive remained standard across the lineup, paired with either a six-speed manual (in some markets) or Subaru's Lineartronic continuously variable transmission (CVT). The interior saw the most dramatic changes, with substantially increased passenger space, particularly in rear seat legroom, and a more conventional design focused on mainstream appeal rather than the sporty character of previous generations. Technology features expanded to include available touchscreen infotainment systems, advanced safety features like Subaru's EyeSight driver assistance system, and enhanced connectivity options. This generation represented Subaru's effort to capture a larger share of the mainstream mid-size sedan market, particularly in North America, by offering more competitive interior space and comfort features while maintaining the all-weather capability and safety focus that distinguished the brand. While this approach broadened the model's appeal to family sedan buyers, some enthusiasts lamented the reduction in performance variants and the more conservative overall character compared to previous generations."

The interior represents the most significant advancement, featuring a more premium design with higher quality materials and, on most trim levels, a portrait-oriented 11.6-inch touchscreen infotainment system dominating the center stack, offering improved connectivity, navigation, and vehicle controls. Passenger space remains generous, with a focus on long-distance comfort through improved seating, reduced noise levels, and enhanced ride quality. Safety technology has been further expanded with the latest version of Subaru's EyeSight driver assistance system now standard across all models, offering adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and pre-collision braking, with higher trim levels adding driver monitoring systems that can detect driver fatigue or distraction. The seventh-generation Legacy continues to appeal to buyers seeking the security of all-wheel drive and Subaru's reputation for reliability and safety in a traditional sedan format, offering a compelling alternative in a segment increasingly abandoned by competitors as the market shifts toward crossovers and SUVs."
